Ubuntu Package - Day 2

Ubuntu installs software from online repositories.

These repositories are defined in:
/etc/apt/sources.list

Each repository line tells the system:
- Where to download packages from
- Which Ubuntu release to use
- Which software category (main, universe, etc.)

When running apt update:
- Ubuntu refreshes the package list from these sources
- No software is installed at this stage

This system allows:
- Secure software delivery
- Centralised updates
- Dependency management
