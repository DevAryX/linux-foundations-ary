# Linux Foundations - Ary

### Why This Repo Exists

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning Linux fundamentals.
Over about two months, I worked directly in Ubuntu, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly getting comfortable living in the terminal.

This is a record of what I’ve practiced, automated, and actually used while learning how Linux systems work under the hood.

Monitoring running processes, killing stuck jobs, and checking services

Networking basics
Simple diagnostics with tools like ping, curl, and port checks

Bash scripting
Variables, conditionals, loops, and reusable scripts

Automation
Cron jobs and small automations that solve real problems
