# Linux Foundations — Ary

## Overview

This repo is my **Linux fundamentals portfolio**, a hands-on journey through key sysadmin concepts, terminal mastery, scripting, and automation built on Ubuntu. Over 2 months I worked through real tasks, projects, and scripts that show how I work from the command line and solve problems using Bash.
